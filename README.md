## Description
This repository represents a remote collaboration for LightBot Fuzzy Logic Adaptive Traffic Control Solution offered by 5DT for the COS 301 Capstone University of Pretoria. The purpose of LightBot is to minimize the delays that are caused by traffic congestions at various intersections. The LightBot system will be used to prove a concept that the addition of a fuzzy logic algorithm will develop a good policy for which to control the traffic lights at a given intersection.

    <summary><b>What I Did </b></summary>
    <br>
    - Demo 3: Set up new MongoDB database with relevant data, set up new Git repository, set up new Node.js Web Server, continued with web application React development (LightBot Dashboard interface), created new traffic Simulation interface & manual override interaction of Simulation, updated the SRS document, updated User Manual, created Coding Standards document, created Technical Installations Manual and recorded the demo video.
    <br>
    - Demo 4: Updated, debugged and finished the LightBot web application and connected it to a domain. The whole system is running on a remote server which can be accessed from any remote desktop. I improved the simulator interface and implemented the Fuzzy Logic Contoller. I updated and finalised the SRS document, the User Manual and created the Testing policy document. I implemented automated non-functional requirements testing, and recorder the demo video.
